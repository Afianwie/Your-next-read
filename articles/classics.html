        <h4>Read Actively</h4>
        <p>Classic literature often requires more active reading than contemporary works. Take notes, look up historical context, and don't hesitate to use study guides or annotations to enhance your understanding.</p>

        <h3>Modern Relevance</h3>
        
        <h4>"1984" and Digital Surveillance</h4>
        <p>Orwell's vision of constant surveillance feels eerily prescient in our age of social media and data collection, making discussions about privacy and government control more relevant than ever.</p>
        
        <h4>"The Handmaid's Tale" and Women's Rights</h4>
        <p>Margaret Atwood's dystopian novel about reproductive rights and women's autonomy continues to spark important conversations about gender equality and bodily autonomy.</p>
        
        <h4>"Brave New World" and Technology</h4>
        <p>Aldous Huxley's vision of a society controlled through pleasure and distraction rather than force offers a different perspective on modern concerns about technology and social control.</p>
        
        <h3>Building Your Classic Reading List</h3>
        <p>If you're new to classic literature, consider starting with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shorter works to build confidence</li>
            <li>Authors from your own cultural background</li>
            <li>Works that have been adapted into films you've enjoyed</li>
            <li>Books recommended by trusted friends or teachers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Classic literature isn't just about reading "important" books – it's about connecting with the wisdom, beauty, and insight that has endured across centuries. These works offer windows into different times and places while revealing the fundamental aspects of human experience that unite us all.</p>
